# Basics of threading

### Threading allow us to speed up programs by executing multiple tasks at the SAME time
### Each task will run on its own thread
### Each thread can run simultaneously and share data with each other
### Every thread when you start it must do something, which we can define with a function
### Our threads will then target these functions
### When we start the threads, these target function will run
### Thread can be used once. To resuse it we must re-define that thread
